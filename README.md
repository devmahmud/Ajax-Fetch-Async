# Ajax-Fetch-Async
In this project i have first created XMLHttpRequest to fetch api data, Then i have implemented call back, Promises and then async await to fetch Api data instead of promises.

This project contains all core functionality of asynchronious javascript including two version of EasyHttp Library Which can be used to fetch api data.also illustrates that how things changed over ES5 -> ES6 -> ES6 for working with api.
